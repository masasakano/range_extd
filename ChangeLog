(Version: 1.1)
2019-11-01  Masa Sakano
  * Significant upgrade: RangeExtd
    * size of RangeExtd with an infinity now follows what Ruby Endless Range returns.
      * Example: (?a..RangeExtd::Infinity::POSITIVE).size used to be Float::INFINITY, but now nil.
    * RangeExtd::Infinity::POSITIVE etc now replaced with Float::INFINITY when it should be.
  * RangeExtd::Infinity
    * POSITIVE (or NEGATIVE) and Float::INFINITY are now NOT comparable. Description added to README.
    * Newly redefined methods of ">" and "<" for RangeExtd::Infinity, as otherwise the comparison with Numeric fails as of Ruby 2.6 (I do not know whether it has been so or it has changed in recent versions of Ruby)
    * New class methods of Infinity.infinity? and Infinity.infinite? in which the former excludes Float::INFINITY whereas the latter includes.
    * Two unary operators (plus and minus) now supported.
    * The methods "=", ">" and "<" redefined for Float and Integer (hence Rational) so they can be compared with this.
